Also, please check the component type name as `ThreeDBarChart` '(As we map component in `Dashboard/component/DataView.jsx` ')from backend as well. Because it’s added in backend script add in prod we can’t change.
2. **REUSE THE EXISTING COMPONENT WITH PROPS**  
  Can’t we reuse existing component '(i.e. `BarChart`, `DualAxisBarChart`') and add 3d props to as options in `chartOptions`. The way we are doing now, any changes in bar kind of chart in future we have to do all the components.

I am not convinced with the approach we took here. As we are projecting we have solved this using **Doubly  LinkedList** approach to **optimise complexity**. But here what we are doing more iteration than simple **Array** implementation. Also we are switching between **LinkedList <=> Array** in every single action.

Now we are playing with less number of items '(i.e. Joins') now we are not observing much difference here.

The purpose of this change is to handle “breaking chart type” even if we get junk data for selected chart type.

With DIY coming out as a tool, we do not have any control on what widgets will be created by people and which chart type will they select to plot their data.

So, in case, we get invalid data, instead of breaking the chart or page, we are handling that error by showing appropriate message.  
  
To explain the logic which we are adapting here, please read the points below:

* For tables, we are not modifying any data points at this level.
* For chart types, we are doing following:

    * In case, where values to be plotted on Y-axis is coming as NULL, empty string, etc… we modify the data to 0 and display chart.
    * In case, where values to be plotted on Y-axis is coming as string, we are showing an error to user with invalid data.
