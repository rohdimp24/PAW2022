props name selectedjoins instead of joins it will be same pattern like selectedmeasures selecteddimensions 	code suggestion
actually we are putting unnecessary checks here joins .map . . . should be good enough . f ea d fb a f c can you refactor it all the places in this component ?	refactoring suggestion
 f ea d fb a f c please check the following point can we keep in the function where it s required ? i see only used in one place . check the below reusable code snippet const default join key map joinedkey parentkey const default join table jointype joinkeysmaps . . .default join key map 	code suggestion
 f ea d fb a f c i think we are doing cleanup here . instead of clean up can we let s do a validation in the component itself . don t allow user to add another join if table field of last join is not filled . 	logical suggestion
 f ea d fb a f c try to create new array reference instead of mutating the same object reference . here you are updating selected joins by modifying the exiting array i .e . object before calling onchangejoins . it s not a best practice . const handleremovejoin onchangejoins . . . joins .slice reference to read array .prototype .splice array .prototype .slice 	code suggestion
does arr .reduce is required here ? const handlechangejoin index updatedjoin const updatejoins joins .map join i i index ? updatedjoin join onchangejoins . . .updatejoins 	code suggestion
by default it always pick index file import join actions from . . constants 	code suggestion
 we don t need the handler here . this functionality should be internal to the each join . so i think we should keep it in joinscard component . external to joinscard component always should be add update or remove whole join object .	buggycode suggestion
i think it should done instead of save . because we are not saving anything in backend here . it just closing the dialog updating json in the ui .	logical suggestion
what the use of the box here ?	questioning
 import join keys join actions from . . constants 	code suggestion

why if and else the reduce will work irrespective of length . also if there is no condition then it shouldn t even evaluate or come here . correct ?	code suggestion
you can put all the color bgcolor and other variables result here itself . so no need to evaluate multiple times .	code suggestion
why this change ?	questioning
 e a b fe a c ad c you used this variable to keep temporary modified state in project dialog . now this is getting used in other implementation as well . this is a duplicate data of measures and dimensions i .e . selectedmeasures selecteddimensions respectively . in future we will have confusion of which veritable is doing what ! ! ! playground should have only modified i .e . applied state of any data i .e . measures dimensions joins etc . otherwise we should move dialog change states inside respective component .	buggycode suggestion
selectedprojections is the updated list of projections . currently playground is having the applied data for selectedprojections . also in this case selectedprojections is used for reference data . this is not being updated at any level inside columncard properties menu dialog . going forward we will have to keep the respective states for each component . as this is growing too big and debugging will get harder at each point .	code suggestion
 e a b fe a c ad c when we are doing changes in columnpropertiesdialog only that point we have data difference in selectedprojections otherwise it s a same duplicate data combining measures dimensions . we have to remove selectedprojections from playground . else somewhere we will use selectedprojections and somewhere selectedmeasures and selecteddimensions f ea d fb a f c please do don t use selectedprojections here use selectedmeasures selecteddimensions based of type 	buggycode suggestion
 b e e c c bb f okay understood basically getting the same source of truth everywhere and using that . . instead of creating confusion . f ea d fb a f c please note and implement accordingly	code suggestion

 e a b fe a c ad c what was the reason behind removing this slice ?	questioning
 e a b fe a c ad c whenever changing the join table of a join card the tablestodisplay list should not update at the same moment after adding a join card or removing a joincard tablestodisplay should update . because of the removal of this slice impacting this flow after choosing the join table at the same time the list also updating which is not correct .	buggycode suggestion
looks good to me on the oneview side . b e e c c bb f please check on the retailer app side	completeness suggestion
why this is required ?	questioning

as of now yes the condition was blocking users from going to subquery playground page on click of the button . we have to implement the loading ux soon .	completeness suggestion
 e a b fe a c ad c so this issue still exists 	buggycode suggestion

this looks to me a revert of some changes . why such changes ?	questioning
also the changes here will reflect in all pages . please test it out thoroughly before making such changes .	buggycode suggestion
can t we use extras .spacing .bystep spacing here ?	code suggestion
why this change ? selection key will contain the last state of the joins within the dialog component .	code suggestion
 f ea d fb a f c that s the default behaviour . what s the expected behaviour by the product ?	questioning
 f ea d fb a f c okay then do onselection applied 	code suggestion
at this level can we do a useexplicitapply function ? similar to what is there in joins ?	code suggestion
why is this ?	questioning
i hope you have checked this functionality thoroughly	completeness suggestion
i hope you have checked all the validations regarding this .	completeness suggestion
can you handle this in the columnpropertiesdialog component itself ? you are already passing the type there	code suggestion
why don t you just take currentprojections ?	logical suggestion
why are you using selectedprojections here ?	questioning
even if selectedprojections is empty this will always be considered even though projections are non empty . please handle this	buggycode suggestion
so when we are editing the widget where is the source of projection coming from ?	questioning

 f ea d fb a f c you will be applying it based on selectedfilters and supportedfilters . these are your sources . you can use these two and show the filter	code suggestion
from backend this will be a list non optional	buggycode suggestion
 f ea d fb a f c please check for all the filters i think some cases are definitely not working . plus please check with product team regarding the wordings	buggycode suggestion
that is fine when i apply userhierarchy on some widgets then that also fails . even though it s there in supported filter . widget trend of mbo	buggycode suggestion
you can directly return you re not using the temporary variables .	code suggestion
you can use map instead of reduce	code suggestion
looks good to me . we will have to do the backend changes accordingly for this	completeness suggestion
 should not be the default value	buggycode suggestion
will fail in production . table id is different there	buggycode suggestion
please mark a todo here for the chart type	completeness suggestion
okay later on we have to enhance this in such a way that only on table selection or alias writing the fetch configurations is called . right now it calls even if you select the type of join or select the join parent keys extra calls . please keep this into consideration	completeness suggestion
why are we doing this part ? once base table gets updated and you go to main playground level the fetchconfigurations will be called due to changes in basetable object so it should automatically update . if not there might be a bug at the lower level .	code suggestion
this will fail when we change the base table type	buggycode suggestion
spelling	spelling suggestion
why are we doing this ? also what will this return ?	questioning
 f ea d fb a f c i have one suggestion . can we integrate table selector dialog to playground just as we have integrated it in the subqueryplayground level ? i feel this issue will be solved . please check by creating multiple level subquery as a basetable	logical suggestion
shouldnt this be sending back the linked account details for each retailer warehouse combo ?	buggycode suggestion

please guard against this . also did not understand why you need to subquery ka projections here ?	questioning
why are you setting the projections here ? please explain .	questioning
you can use .some 	code suggestion
 f ea d fb a f c if i have edited the basetable to a simple table . how will this work ?	buggycode suggestion
 f ea d fb a f c i don t think cross checking is required once you change the subquery table then when you go back to playground level a new call is made . your source of truth will be updated . now if your source of truth does not contain the old projection then it will not show ? shouldn t this be the scenario ? please check against this . this would remove unnecessary adding to the projections .	completeness suggestion
 f ea d fb a f c on changing the subquery table your source of truth will be updated . now if your updated source of truth does not contain this old projection will it show up ?	questioning
there is one more bug in this . when you change the alias the projections do disappear but the json is not updated . please check against that	buggycode suggestion
we should be getting the level in condition card popover use that	code suggestion
i just checked this should be hour minute and second	buggycode suggestion
why do you need this ? as far as i remember if you don t supply the values here then it will add all by default . this is just extra work	questioning

we dont need synchronized . make the map as concurrenthashmap	buggycode suggestion
all these should be made local variables if they cannot be initialized as static final . these will not be thread safe and concurrent requests to same widget will over write each other values . please make changes in both the widgets . add them to the context map and then pass them around wherever needed or create a model class for this i would prefer model class .	buggycode suggestion
can u not set the multibrandretailerschema in the widgetdatafetchercontext instead of setting individual params ?	code suggestion
since every where we are using the ocm as table record the model should be encapsulating the same . the retailerutils should be setting this appropriately . if you use it in current form what are you gaining by this model object apart from single call to retailer utils ?	questioning

 ffc ed dbf da ae please take care between singular and plural naming . const companyoutlets unmappedcompanyoutlets as you can see below you are looping through the array so normally it variable name should be companyoutlets .	spelling suggestion
 ffc ed dbf da ae please take care of variable naming . companyoutlets .map companyoutlet index 	spelling suggestion
 ffc ed dbf da ae is there any use of this empty tag ?	questioning
 ffc ed dbf da ae first point index shouldn t be key any key use unique key in an object with understandable strings like below key unmapped companies list c .companyid second when we are doing loop only first tags needs key prop i see here first tag is empty second tag div and third tag card has key .	code suggestion
what about this paddingleft props props .status invoice status .pending ? spacing spacing 	code suggestion
 ffc ed dbf da ae important you should put this image in all the apps folders	code suggestion

hardcoded colors and css are not allowed . please use theme . can t be it should multiple of here . note same as below lines . 	buggycode suggestion
 ffc ed dbf da ae obviously i have repeatedly saying this to you .	buggycode suggestion
 ffc ed dbf da ae again i am commenting this why width and height props are required can t set in classes .img styles	code suggestion
why we are not using props directly . eg spacing palette all . same as companies .jsx	code suggestion

 ffc ed dbf da ae why we are getting this file changes ?	questioning
 ffc ed dbf da ae there are unnecessary changes in this file i think node modules are not updated . you should run yarn in root directory of the repository it will check and update you node modules .	buggycode suggestion
 ffc ed dbf da ae i am also telling you the same . as per e a b fe a c ad c last comment he asked you to move this from every file you declared before .	buggycode suggestion

should we not return only dashboard ids instead of dashboard as discussed this is breaking due to permission issue while resolving other parameters of dashboard .	buggycode suggestion
cannot be added . . this will expose the api and also bring it under authentication flow . from what i understood this is supposed to be an internal api bypassing the auth flow . hence should be exposed as rest api without the preauthorize annotation .	buggycode suggestion

are we going to implement any logic at this method ?	questioning
 fb f df c f please share the sql script that you used for inserting this new chart type in the backend	completeness suggestion
 fb f df c f i have two points to make overall . rename the component and component type name in backend why we are named it threednullchart ? as i see this is a bar chart with d effect . so please name it threedbarchart .jsx . also please check the component type name as threedbarchart as we map component in dashboard component dataview .jsx from backend as well . because it s added in backend script add in prod we can t change . . reuse the existing component with props can t we reuse existing component i .e . barchart dualaxisbarchart and add d props to as options in chartoptions . the way we are doing now any changes in bar kind of chart in future we have to do all the components . fyi e a b fe a c ad c f ea d fb a f c aaf e a d e b c d d db 	refactoring suggestion
 visualisation ! 	logical suggestion
 fb f df c f we don t need to change any function as we are not changing any functionality of existing charts . we are just changing the way of visualisation i .e . d . i believe we should pass a props as isthreed true false which will determine the options d option chart . . . options d enabled true alpha beta depth as we are creating another chart another chart we are adding cost of testing for all the feature again . also suppose in future if we do fix enhancement in bar chart we have to do this all these d components as well .	code suggestion

 f ea d fb a f c codewise looks good to me . please test the use case properly though and impact areas . approving from my side .	completeness suggestion
should we make this enum ? if it is kept as strings then any new msg format can just put in anything they want . will it have any impact on the caching ? if no then do we need these constants here ?	buggycode suggestion
ideally this should be little more than the retry window in the flow . so we might have to look for a dynamic ttl .	buggycode suggestion
shouldnt the values be coming from the config instead of the constants in the service tier ?	buggycode suggestion
this will need changes when we get to a point to integrate with local vendors in other countries . wouldnt it be better to have a config something like yaml providers kaleyra msg types otp . . . dial codes . . . key . . . . . . . . . kaleyra promo msg types promotional dial codes all key . . . . . . . . 	code suggestion
why do we need separate timeouts for diff countries ?	buggycode suggestion
why are we creating a new object each time ? this will be a heavy operation . please make sure these are singleton objects .	buggycode suggestion
plz confirm if this is meant only for retailer module . my understanding was that this would be a generic flow .	questioning
no db call should be needed . this should be done using cache totally .	buggycode suggestion
this should not be needed .	logical suggestion
index based vendor pickup should be hidden from the caller .	logical suggestion
can it not be a single fetch instead of lookup and fetch ?	questioning
the logic is fine but doing this filter each time is a costly operation for sending large number of notifications . ideally a map of dial code vendors should be prepared from config during init . we had talked about the map in our discussion . merging this as it is fine functionally but please make the changes to make it faster .	buggycode suggestion
 aaf e a d e b c d d db instead of this . could you please go with following convention in all components so that the d options will not be appended to the chart object un necessarily on each render . chart !isthreed ? . . .chartstyles type column height width . . .chartstyles . . .threedstyles type column height width 	code suggestion
after following above comments . changes at config level will be as follows export const threedstyles options d enabled isthreed alpha beta depth 	code suggestion

if more than positions are required in future better to keep it as number now only so that you don t have to revisit this part again . unless that s the plan	logical suggestion
please make all of these as optional as reports page doesn t use this and will not use it for their table view . legendposition ? boolean denotes optional . please check once on the reports page as this is not required .	code suggestion
arrow here is unnecessary i feel it can come in restprops	logical suggestion
since chart properties is a string write it directly no need of 	code suggestion
address above comment at all the places	buggycode suggestion
add scrollbar styles one place can create inconsistency in overall app . in future developers will copy paste styles everywhere rather i would recommend if we can set this globally .	buggycode suggestion
how do we decided vh ? how do we decided the height when a page is embedded ? this will create inconsistency in overall layout . we need to measure every list container hight and make it fixed height .	buggycode suggestion
 aaf e a d e b c d d db as i updated in the ticket i am not onboard with this requirement . are we going to fix every page height and put fixed a fixed height of every container which contains a list ? technically this is not way it s suppose to be . fyi e a b fe a c ad c f ea d fb a f c 	buggycode suggestion
 aaf e a d e b c d d db i am not sure by looking at the screenshot . but we have done some override in createtheme .js file . i would request you to do some more research on this .	completeness suggestion
let s look into why we can t work with height from contentrect and try to fixed the root cause . let s not hardcode by looking at your screen . what of this screen running into embedded view like bizom web or mobile app ?	logical suggestion
why we are hardcoding like this ? this is not recommended .	buggycode suggestion
why we are hardcoding with vh ? how this will work in embedded mode like inside iframe bizom 	buggycode suggestion

 const view preference scope new new update update instead of having two props here can we have only one prop called scope as below type props classes any scope new update based on scope this component will work .	code suggestion
 ffc ed dbf da ae this is not the right way of doing it we are making modal every time true but you are stopping we are stopping modal to buy checking communications .length why we are not doing in the same where we are doing setcommunications initiallist there we already know what is the length of the initiallist .	buggycode suggestion
 then the pop up wont come until the data is loaded int intiallist na ! in the mean time he might go to a different page i am assuming this can happen not sure though ffc ed dbf da ae if this is your logic then does it work now as per your logic ? ? ? go through your code in this line you wrote communications .length . . and you are making setopen true which is passed open open in this line does it make any sense ? ? ? 	buggycode suggestion
 ffc ed dbf da ae why again you are adding string in caps how many times i will comment the same thing .	refactoring suggestion
we are complicating things by adding two states here we should handle with once state because at time this component will view in one scope i .e . new or update 	buggycode suggestion
 ffc ed dbf da ae you are creating duplicate variable here which holds same kind of data and does the same job . now let s come understand what complicates . performance complexity every code we write in the frontend builds and ships to user device browser . so every code we write complies to some file and size . more you write more size increases . . maintenance complexity we have to always fix implement two places . i can give you live example right way we are getting below warning in console please try to fix it warning each child in a list should have a unique key prop . . finally more code point right more condition point right more test cases point right more bugs . hope this helps you .	buggycode suggestion

 a e a f b e d d ed e first of we are not following bootstrap or material design here we are trying to define and follow mds i .e . mobisy design system . i think you defining muted with c d as i mentioned above color should be an props for all typography that way each typography can change it s color it shouldn t be px text is muted .	buggycode suggestion
 a e a f b e d d ed e props .theme .spacing is not the right property of radius why can t we use theme .shape .borderradius ?	buggycode suggestion
 theme .spacing is not correct property for line height need to see why we are doing it . marking as todo .	buggycode suggestion

 f ea d fb a f c is there any other way except useeffect multiple useeffect can cause inconsistency in the component .	buggycode suggestion
 f ea d fb a f c let us change the name for this prop . may be something like accordionsummaryclasses	spelling suggestion
ok what i meant was this . accordionsummarycontext ? object something like this if provided then we will you those css classes else we will use default css . this way we will able to keep functionality away from component definition .	code suggestion
just one point . it should not affect the other apps default themes . b e e c c bb f f ea d fb a f c please have a look on retailer app . if all good on your end then please approve it .	completeness suggestion
have few points here . need to override color from respective app pwa app . we need to add shade for primary color otherwise many places will break point down ! . we need to know about the color system 	buggycode suggestion
this can throw an exception if filters don t have cities . please guard against the scenario	buggycode suggestion
 ffc ed dbf da ae just guard the citiesselectedvalue based on filteroncities . otherwise all things looks good to me .	code suggestion
 ffc ed dbf da ae if i have a dashboard without any filters how will city filter show up ? try it for a dashboard without any filters and see if it works .	completeness suggestion
it can still cause an exception if filteroncities does not have the selectedvalues key . ffc ed dbf da ae please confirm that filteroncities have selectedvalues	buggycode suggestion
why this key name r ?	questioning
 d aae b ea c e f a okay you can use the entire name itself if possible so that there won t be any doubts in the future about this	logical suggestion
 not critical we should initialize all variables at a global level for consistency . 	logical suggestion
this logic does not seem to be correct . this is company specific outlet table . this will give all the retailers that are not present in the company db ph no . match which will pick even those that have not been associated with this company .	buggycode suggestion
why like query ?	buggycode suggestion
what does enabled mean ? based on the query it seems that you are picking all outlets that are active in the company db but do no exist in retailer db . basically those that have not been onboarded on retailer app yet . is this what we are looking for ?	questioning
why are we checking only the retailer table everywhere ? where is the lookup on ocm table to get company mapping ?	buggycode suggestion
 d aae b ea c e f a there can still be times when we dont have mapping of the company with the outlet in the retailer db . i believe without ocm mapping this will not give you correct numbers .	buggycode suggestion
i have done review only code wise logic but dont have idea about retailer query .	completeness suggestion

 e a b fe a c ad c why is this info needed ? as per my understanding for a given company there shall be one contact hierarchy for a given outlet and only contact numbers are needed maybe name as well . . why do we have to expose the ids ?	questioning
 e a b fe a c ad c based on current requirements contact details is a single structure comprising of name phone number . then you should have a contact hierarchy type that has fields of contact details for company warehouse area . . etc . any particular reason we are going with enum based approach ? what is the contract finalized with ui ? how are they expecting the data and displaying it ?	questioning

why are you collecting to list ? this list is not used . i think proper code would be widgetdatafetcher .getname .foreach m action fetcher map .putifabsent m widgetdatafetcher 	code suggestion
i think schedular fetcher list is not needed at all . we can use the action fetcher map itself to find out if actionkey is present or not .	code suggestion

keep this in costants file import here use .	buggycode suggestion
we can do this using .map on array and put one array like tooltip messages dimensions measures tableselector kind of	code suggestion

instead of passing would be better to make it the input parameters as integer and pass null where ever we do not need it . the above condition would then change to page null limit null . this is because page is valid input for pagination .	logical suggestion

what reasons are these ? specific to an order ? if yes then i think order id should be an input .	logical suggestion
afaik graphql does not allow overloading . will ui break if we release it this way ?	buggycode suggestion

rename all variable name as enum it has two advantages . it keeps more readable and from where it s coming . . it resolves the variable name clash with other imports from a different file e .g export const enum sku status . . . export const enum product name . . . 	code suggestion
let s keep everything into strings .js file and removed this file because of below reasons . it will reduce the chance of creating duplicate variables . developers need to think of which is considered as error message success message general strings . for example cart updated and order placed successfully is not an error message .	refactoring suggestion
move these variable to enums .js file because these are constants only . strings .js files should contain strings which needs to translated in future . e .g . const rupeesign u b others signs . . . export const emum currency aed aed euro euro inr inr kes kes sar sar unknown unknown usd usd export const emum currency signs emum currency .inr rupeesign other signs . . . 	code suggestion

 f ea d fb a f c design looks a bit odd but this is the product call . i understand the point for your changes	logical suggestion
please check whether button api has a start icon or not . if so you can use that	reuse suggestion

why we have not reused customtextfield here ?	reuse suggestion
we should not create our own props . it should same props as textfield has	buggycode suggestion

is there any functional issue due to this ? if not then a proper fix w o such inactive filter should be done . if we have usecases where inactive mappings are needed then we need entitygraph else a normal where annotation would suffice .	buggycode suggestion
why are there css changes ? the ticket doesn t mention anything	questioning
why is this removed ?	questioning
why are we processing only pending ocm entries ? you should be fetching the ocm mapping for the given guid and company from the event and if it exists mark the status to whatever is incoming from the event . if not present in ocm event is assoc then add an entry do you see any issue with the above approach ?	logical suggestion
why is being handled separately ?	questioning
 e a b fe a c ad c then should it not be stringutils .isnotempty dialcode ? dialcode ?	code suggestion
in disassoc you will not be creating the record . you should be marking it inactive only if the record already exists .	buggycode suggestion
no point in throwing this . . an error msg is good enough . there is no caller to this .	logical suggestion

is the space required ?	refactoring suggestion
to just add a vertical padding we have created a button is it useful ? when we customise button component it should be override the button default styles not what should be around the button .	logical suggestion

this is the third useeffect in this file going forward we may have stability issue here .	buggycode suggestion
why is this extra check required ?	questioning
so if you have a newvalue then you are not using it anywhere in the function ? why do you require this ?	refactoring suggestion
your variable name is in positive sense but your check condition is in the negative sense . please make it clear . use something like const isfieldandcomparisontypepresent tempcomparisonmodel tempcomparisonmodel the brackets indicate the key inside .	code suggestion
why are we starting validation with true ?	questioning
please write the reverse way of this . code will be hard to read for people in future .	code suggestion

can we remove the console if not required ?	refactoring suggestion
why is the variable address ?	spelling suggestion
we have discussed to make similar structure . why we are not doing this ? otherwise we are writing if else in every function .	buggycode suggestion
 f ea d fb a f c every time action we are converting structure from linked list array and vice versa . so we are using tree for doing operation and array for displaying component purpose . if i understand it correctly we are trying to use linkedlist structure to optimise iterations and performance . as per above execution are we really achieving our goal ? is it not costing us more ?	buggycode suggestion
instead of two operations if we update the current node value with default join would that not solve our problem . or if we can have a replace function ?	code suggestion
 check function naming please instead of specific validation function please have one common validation function 	buggycode suggestion
 f ea d fb a f c did you check this comment ?	completeness suggestion
 f ea d fb a f c i am not convinced with the approach we took here . as we are projecting we have solved this using doubly linkedlist approach to optimise complexity . but here what we are doing more iteration than simple array implementation . also we are switching between linkedlist array in every single action . now we are playing with less number of items i .e . joins now we are not observing much difference here . even if we play with joins that s a huge number i believe for this case we won t observe much of a difference there . so please discuss and take opinion from ba f f c cbe e a b fe a c ad c aaf e a d e b c d d db others as well and proceed . note please make sure there is no other change except re arrange in this pr 	buggycode suggestion
 a e a f b e d d ed e if we don t need this can we remove commented code ?	refactoring suggestion
 a e a f b e d d ed e don t use only index as key try to create unique string with company id and all . suppose there is another loop in the same page . and developer don t check the already written loops key .	buggycode suggestion
why is the default value an empty object ?	buggycode suggestion
 a e a f b e d d ed e please write everything into sentence pattern in strings file . if we have to uppercase lowercase then we should do it in css label . otherwise if we need the same string other places then we have keep duplicate strings in this file and translate it to multiple time for the same strings . 	buggycode suggestion
if we don t need it then we can remove it right now .	refactoring suggestion
 export const order id order id or export const id id which one we need ?	questioning
 a e a f b e d d ed e why we are taking only one order ? if we are sorting the list we can show all recent orders .	logical suggestion
this will look like complete order is id . can we keep it order id 	logical suggestion
 a e a f b e d d ed e check the below screen sort ! 	buggycode suggestion

there are few issue enhancement we need to take care .	buggycode suggestion

shouldn t this be mandatory ?	questioning
i think id column already exists in the baseentityretailer . please remove from here if it exists in parent class .	code suggestion
 e a b fe a c ad c i hope you have checked the batchjobs and consumers to verify that any call doesnt fail due to audit columns security context might not be present in these entry points and the hibernate audit would fail in that case 	completeness suggestion
 b e e c c bb f as discussed following are the observations . . please see if versions can be enforced using the json rather than lock . try multiple commits with one each of the profile . add superm profile for ios similar to what is present in android . please try to refactor the scripts to use platform as parameter rather than maintaining individual scripts per platform . check on the usage of environment variable for the app name do let me know if any further discussion is needed . 	completeness suggestion
please check with product about the error message	logical suggestion
when you open a fresh diy page you immediately show the error message . even if i m clicking on the delete icon the card is not getting removed from the screen . please check this scenario once .	buggycode suggestion
please fill values	spelling suggestion
i feel this is a bad way of checking whether an error is present because i see too many string value . a simpler way would be to do it boolean style	buggycode suggestion
please fill values all caps 	spelling suggestion
 f ea d fb a f c have you checked the spelling of the variables ?	spelling suggestion
why the ?	questioning
i think you need comma in the graphql method	buggycode suggestion
typography doesn t have ondoubleclick property where is it coming from ?	code suggestion
no need to create this much of style . just using box with align left should work here .	code suggestion
 aaf e a d e b c d d db you have to use typography itself . but wrap it with box do align left . and remove class from typography .	code suggestion
pr looks good to me . if anirudh s suggestion can be implemented then well and good . pre approving it	completeness suggestion
why don t you use filter directly ?	code suggestion
why are we adding this col in audit table as well ? can it not be picked from the parent notification table ?	code suggestion
this should be part of parent table i guess .	logical suggestion
will this have an impact on other places where same object is being used ?	questioning
why the space ?	refactoring suggestion
why the space ?	refactoring suggestion
error message ?	refactoring suggestion
as discussed please update the pr with the comment as to why these changes are necessary it s not an obvious flow which people will understand . so some context would be required . pre approving the pr as changes explained looks good to me . 	documentation suggestion
this comment should be present just before line as it is describing about the function getloyalty .	logical suggestion
you are already in settings object . quantitysetting showquantity quantityoption something like this looks good 	code suggestion
 aaf e a d e b c d d db please try classname fabclasses .fabbutton instead of classes root fabclasses .fabbutton i guess it should work .	code suggestion

is it possible to have an interface for fileupload and have tus specific implementation as an implementation of the same . currently all classes config names are tied up with tus .	logical suggestion
plz remove the engine and other params . we will use what db provides at global level .	buggycode suggestion
generic name for controller why tus specific controller ?	buggycode suggestion
similarly these should be coded to interface instead of the implementation .	buggycode suggestion
why not generic uploadresponse ?	code suggestion
do we need to have the resumable in the path in all the apis ? are we planning to support non resumable upload apis ? if no then we dont need it in the path .	code suggestion
plz change this to debug .	code suggestion
better to add a single info logger statement to print the request context like companyid userid . . whatever is need to uniquely identify the request .	logical suggestion
hardcoded to true ? if this is just a stub please add some comments and todo to tag it for later .	buggycode suggestion
would it be better to use the the fileuploadresponse object here itself instead of conversion to map and then to the domain model ? any specific reason to use map ?	code suggestion
why a map as return value ?	questioning
should the response not contain a unique upload id or is it part of the offset header only ? all other apis are returning on a similar pattern is it how the client would be expecting just the offsets instead of complete uploadresponse including identifier ?	buggycode suggestion
this can be covered using tus specific service layer . the controller layer should be generic .	buggycode suggestion
normally the servletrequest and servletresponse are kept limited to the controller tier . controller should be converting them to models and passing them to the services downstream if needed .	logical suggestion
is the head supported in the apigateway codebase ?	questioning
are we supporting zone info in the date field de serialization ? not working with utc ?	questioning
what use would require to connect to company dbs ? is the upload info not stored in a common central db ?	questioning
why is this needed ?	questioning
where is this used ?	questioning
 d dbd ea c c f b my take is publish the contract work with the utc . not sure where the data time thing would be coming into picture if it is just to tag the request timing that is your service internal client has nothing to do with it and need to pass it .	logical suggestion
the issue with storing all this in the db is that the secret keys are now visible to all . atleast with config we have a way to hide them using vault etc . also unlike db access prod config access is limited to few developers .	logical suggestion
do we really need the operationservice ?	questioning

 aaf e a d e b c d d db why to use true false in string .	buggycode suggestion
 aaf e a d e b c d d db use enum values instead of true false . i .e . dashboard section report section and set these values itself for the state .	buggycode suggestion
remove log	refactoring suggestion
this is a default value should it be an object ?	questioning
would suggest to keep it in the constants enum file which can be used in other places of the code	buggycode suggestion
 sectionsenum .report section is sufficient . can be applied to others as well	code suggestion
isn t isreport sectionsenum .report section sufficient ?	questioning
can put to a constants or enum file	buggycode suggestion
this is defining the flow types for an enum . this should be kept and the data line row should use this	buggycode suggestion
space is required ?	refactoring suggestion
this and the next part you are sorting twice . can we not sort it once ?	logical suggestion
default ?	questioning
why is this removed ?	questioning
i think we can store it in a constant if we haven t already and re use wherever possible 	buggycode suggestion
 aaf e a d e b c d d db we can re create . please plan for such if there is not enough time for now	logical suggestion
you can do !iscardhidden since the other element is null	code suggestion
object .keys currentjson .length should be good	code suggestion
please change the variable naming it implies that you are depending on a particular card to show something here . i believe the card should be hidden is depending on some condition . use that same condition and name it correctly so that anyone reading this code should be able to understand	spelling suggestion
we should be having a common function for this	buggycode suggestion
ischiphidden . get and is are the same meaning is is for boolean while get is for other types	spelling suggestion
same as the comment regarding variable naming	spelling suggestion
if this is checking on whether projection is hidden please use the common function	code suggestion
with the audit annotations do we still need these set calls here and above ?	questioning
where is typography being used ?	questioning
 aaf e a d e b c d d db i don t have access to these sprints can you tell me in short what are the expected changes ?	questioning

interface should start will capital letter	spelling suggestion
to avoid null pointer exception change to this if ars hershey auto scheduling action .equals schedularinputs .getactionkey 	buggycode suggestion
we should put these constants at some common place and use it here and in dataconfig of continousreplinshment widget .	buggycode suggestion
use distributorwisefactor map instead of distributororderforppg to avoid additional lookup	buggycode suggestion

why and ? why not labelidx and keyidx ?	questioning
please write comment documentation properly here . . we are considering index as level of slice in pie chart . we are considering index as value of slice in pie chart 	documentation suggestion
 f ea d fb a f c we don t need this line because when developer will read doesn t know what we had in the past .	buggycode suggestion
i think the keyword was hidden . please check once . if it s the case then please make a constant out of this .	code suggestion
please change the unhidden to display or some positive word .	spelling suggestion
 f ea d fb a f c we should rename this file as advancedanalysisdialog 	spelling suggestion

i see this in a few places please extract out a function instead	refactoring suggestion
please put some log statement if required so that we get an understanding of what went wrong	refactoring suggestion

i hope you have considered the map data also . please verify it against that	code suggestion
okay fine we are just checking whether it s against the table or not . can you put up the ticket so that it s clear what is expected ?	logistics suggestion
 b e e c c bb f e a b fe a c ad c i would like to draw your attention towards this change . the purpose of this change is to handle breaking chart type even if we get junk data for selected chart type . with diy coming out as a tool we do not have any control on what widgets will be created by people and which chart type will they select to plot their data . so in case we get invalid data instead of breaking the chart or page we are handling that error by showing appropriate message . to explain the logic which we are adapting here please read the points below for tables we are not modifying any data points at this level . for chart types we are doing following in case where values to be plotted on y axis is coming as null empty string etc we modify the data to and display chart . in case where values to be plotted on y axis is coming as string we are showing an error to user with invalid data . here is one more pr which is related to this pr data inline card 	logical suggestion
why not pass the setter parameters to the mapper api and get the complete object ?	code suggestion
plz remove the enum from the name here and below .	buggycode suggestion

constant string orders should be at the left side of equals to avoid potential npe .	buggycode suggestion
shouldnt this be part of orderresolver ?	code suggestion
can we name just suggestedskus for this query ?	spelling suggestion
please check for the map data also	code suggestion
we need to look back and refactor the datatype and rounding logic for table section it can be written cleanly . approving this as this code has been there from long time and working . will pick refactor later .	refactoring suggestion
what are the changes here ?	questioning
i have one query but the changes otherwise looks good to me . please ensure that for when then conditions taggedconfig should be present if applicable 	code suggestion
please put the ticket for this change . why is the change required ? what were the fixes for this	logistics suggestion
you can the hash for the download id as that is unique	code suggestion
i believe current points to the created date . is that unique enough ? is there no other parameter that can be considered as unique ?	buggycode suggestion
it s named as stickyheader but the style is different . please rename appropriately .	spelling suggestion
please explain it .	questioning
 f ea d fb a f c you are always creating the same id initiated download . instead a proper unique id would be like initiate download hash 	buggycode suggestion
you missed the hint . i ll let you figure it out from the outdated comments	code suggestion
please remove console statement if it s not required	refactoring suggestion
 aaf e a d e b c d d db e a b fe a c ad c do we have config json as input ? does that going effect here ?	questioning
as far as i understand since there are no filters then the payload will be small from the filters part . however the diy json is something that exceeds the normal request size limit . we will have to find a solution for that .	logical suggestion
log the error . . dont use printstacktrace	buggycode suggestion
constant should be on the left side	buggycode suggestion
i dont think the job will finish in m . how much time is it taking for one client ?	buggycode suggestion

 aaf e a d e b c d d db e a b fe a c ad c can we expose comment variable on saved config ? so that we can also set comment at json creation time .	logical suggestion
 e a b fe a c ad c it will helpful to add custom comment to query nothing else .	code suggestion
 ashish kumar why do we need custom comment . these comments are standard fixed to identify in database that which query is taking a lot of time . do you see a need for custom comments ?	reuse suggestion
did you test this change e a b fe a c ad c 	completeness suggestion
please move this to some utility class as this will be used by other widgets too .	code suggestion
can we not pass querytype here only .	code suggestion
instead of setting querytype can we pass it in tosqlcomment ?	code suggestion
nope jooqquerygenerator is used only for custom widget query parse generation .	buggycode suggestion
overall it is same why we need to setquerytype with a separate call . using the constructor will do one call . that s it .	buggycode suggestion
access specifier should be private since we are calling this function in same service .	buggycode suggestion
we should move this flag to customquerymodel .	code suggestion
we won t need setter for this parameter dont expose it .	buggycode suggestion
 c fe ea c cd ee please test extended projection is working fine or not after this change .	completeness suggestion
can assertnull measures too currently we support only params in configurable widget .	questioning
do not set query for other widgets . we have exposed query for configurable widget as it is required by developers .	buggycode suggestion
instead of having a try catch block here we can have a common writer block which will handle the json processing exception . refer to com bizom payment utils objectmapperutils .java line in payment for code level understanding	buggycode suggestion
can we extract this to a common place ? is there a chance for any other modules to use it ?	refactoring suggestion
why are we doing like this ? can we not add to the linkedhashset directly ?	buggycode suggestion

please add the version to the main pom . all the modules should be using the same versions	code suggestion
can we put these constants in one common place ?	refactoring suggestion
you can also use equalsignorecase	code suggestion
why are we using custommessageid ? isn t notificationid enough ?	questioning
you can use phone number utils class for constructing the phone number .	code suggestion
this will fail . b be b a ce a fd please try it out and fix out	buggycode suggestion

test this as per our discussion . delete postgres config from bizom configurations file and test if service is up and running .	completeness suggestion
raise the pr for release branch release 	logistics suggestion
equalsignorecase will be better	code suggestion
ideally this should have been handled at dateutils .getdatevalue class .	buggycode suggestion
me and kumar did not touch that part as it was being utilised in two places . even if we have handled it in dateutils we would have required to handle it here too as dateutils function return localdate object .	logical suggestion
 aaf e a d e b c d d db for the second statement it s already handled here even if it returns null object . for the first statement the only place it would have impacted is at inbetweendatediffcondition file and if we get null there it s meant to fail . so it wouldn t have a difference in the other model class .	logical suggestion
this already handles the null case if it s returned by dateutils class	logical suggestion
we need to clean this up after checking with other team . for now let it go as it is urgent fix .	refactoring suggestion
you can get the db from token itself . token .getdbname 	code suggestion

please check the stringformat class that should do it	code suggestion
please check the stringformat class that should do it	code suggestion
is there a particular reason for doing this ? if there s no key then we should return null itself	code suggestion
why both mapperutils and gson ? we should ideally use 	code suggestion
we can use the annotations at class level itself . also you can use data annotation	code suggestion
 aaf e a d e b c d d db for the last part how is the validity decided ?	questioning
collect is enough	logical suggestion
 aaf e a d e b c d d db from gson side might be some parameter is missing . understood though why both are being used	questioning
you might have to add this to the graphql exception parser if not done so	code suggestion
shouldn t it null itself ?	code suggestion
this much gap . . why ?	questioning
why optional of list ? won t a list suffice ?	code suggestion
dashboardtype .get should suffice	code suggestion
we can use map struct here	logical suggestion
not required	logical suggestion
re runnable please	buggycode suggestion
have you tried editing and removing widget and dashboard from api did it work ?	questioning
please write a foriegn key reference to the dashboard types table	completeness suggestion
this should come above	buggycode suggestion
let s not hardcode the value here	buggycode suggestion
you can just directly return . no need to put it in constructor	logical suggestion
collections .singleton	code suggestion
this is not required	logical suggestion
not required	logical suggestion
i think it looks good but if the test cases can cover both with out org filter then we won t have surprises after this .	completeness suggestion
as both zones and subzones have role id we will end up marking the start level of a zonal manager as subzones . i am not sure how we are differentiating between a zone manager and a sub zone manager in the mapping table atleast we should flip the order between zones and subzones so that it work properly for zonal manager 	logical suggestion
if we flip the case also then there will be no chance of subzones being the startlevel . and many companies don t even have subzone usage . bc e cbaa c c which companies actually use subzones ?	questioning
we can use the ids in orgfilterconstants that will keep only place of change .	logical suggestion
just check whether equals or equalsignorecase will suffice .	logical suggestion
we can avoid the collection here	logical suggestion
we can directly collect to hashmap on iteration don t need for loop	logical suggestion
we don t have to pass a dslcontext ? how is it making the calls to that db ?	buggycode suggestion
with the new changes we will never have empty collections ? if there s nothing then entry will be there with 	buggycode suggestion
why are we not passing the updateduserhierarchymap ? i mentioned about not mutating the original context .	buggycode suggestion
this is mutating the original context we should not be doing so	buggycode suggestion
 aaf e a d e b c d d db my suggestion is .fetchstream .map record intomap .map f long .parselong f .get areaid .tostring 	code suggestion
condition for warehouseid ! ?	code suggestion
i m not comfortable using this . also this will fail for roleid which is report admin	buggycode suggestion
probably have to do somewhat reverse of getting the userids under the given users .	logical suggestion
 aaf e a d e b c d d db if we select multiple users in userfilter then how it will behave ? can we please give me idea ?	questioning
code is breaking for report admin in sales trend geo view	buggycode suggestion
code is breaking for report admin in all reports	buggycode suggestion
shouldn t it be zoneids ?	code suggestion
why this ?	questioning
some widget have boolean parameters in the end and some dont . is there a reason ? i thought we were only going with custom widget changes	questioning
no extra conditions ?	questioning
 aaf e a d e b c d d db i think it should work but check whether the where clause works with the and clause properly .	completeness suggestion
 aaf e a d e b c d d db so only custom widget should be having that change . not other widgets . right now we are not in a scope to test these widgets	buggycode suggestion
 aaf e a d e b c d d db okay . bc e cbaa c c please check this part once . if there s something missing we might as well fix it now	completeness suggestion
 aaf e a d e b c d d db which part is not true ? can you elaborate slightly on this ?	questioning
can we rename it to startlevel or currentlevel ? thislevel doesn t sound correct in context	spelling suggestion
we should also check with null	completeness suggestion
we shouldn t be doing testing in this fashion . ideally this is testing widgetorgutils gethierarchysubqueries . so we should get the actual expected values instead of doing of a replacement . otherwise this is not a clean test case as our test case also contains logic which we aren t testing	buggycode suggestion
we can introduce verifynomoreinteractions this ensures all the stubs are used and no other surprise calls are made .	logical suggestion
 aaf e a d e b c d d db please put a comment in the test cases regarding the decision and what is to be done .	documentation suggestion
please use the existing object mapper .	code suggestion
please fix all the indentations	refactoring suggestion
you should assert that there is an element in the registry	buggycode suggestion

if pre condition is null ?	questioning
i think line handles this case . it is called from this one place only . although we should handle it here too . 	code suggestion
incorrect way of handling it have you tested this it should be something like precondition precondition ! null ? precondition .and joinconditions .convertexpression dslcontext token widgetdatafetchercontext joinconditions .convertexpression dslcontext token widgetdatafetchercontext 	buggycode suggestion
remove collate utf mb unicode ci everywhere	code suggestion
where is widgetrepository used ?	questioning
setstatus crs initiated step crs keyword should always be present in messages	code suggestion
we should update status key in steps after completion and before start of each step	questioning
after step till order generation do we not want to save this information in json crsdata for referral in future .	code suggestion
should we not update status and crsdata with this failure .	questioning
should we not update status and crsdata with this failure .	questioning
 f e f f a a f as discussed the flow seems ok to me . although there are comments which need to be taken care . but as said they do not block us from going forward with this . this will work for now so that we have some logs until d acaf d bc is back . regarding query changes in this widget in arshersheysuggestedorderaction .java file please get it reviewed by bc e cbaa c c sir so as to verify any breaking changes . there are no test cases for this hence we can not verify it . i have seen the generated log entries in bizomreports action logs table it seems fine expect that some places we need to put json currently direct object is put in json . again please get data in this verified by af b a b c and other team members for stored logs . all in all it is ok to send this forward but it will require revisiting and fixing these issues when d acaf d bc is back from holidays .	completeness suggestion
resolve conflict	logistics suggestion
why is there a getter method for this ? ideally we shouldn t be exposing this entire map set maybe a specific cube but not the whole map	buggycode suggestion
we might able to use reverse mapping strategy . not sure if there s one	logical suggestion
 aaf e a d e b c d d db we are exposing the entire cube mapping to the whole of ell code which is not really a great thing to do . someone somewhere will start using by directly accessing the map .	buggycode suggestion
why do you need power mock for this ?	questioning
can t we change appname in config file directly instead of adding under if condition since all the message text is same ? will there be any impact if we do this ?	buggycode suggestion
why only table .getmeasures ?	code suggestion
please rename the file properly	spelling suggestion

why addall is required ? why not a direct insert to hashset one by one ?	code suggestion
just return collections .emptyset	code suggestion

retailerapp .equals 	code suggestion
instead of removing this can we replace it with a blank ?	code suggestion

why did we use stringutils .replace instead of replaceall ?	code suggestion
remove collate utf mb unicode ci	code suggestion
looks good to me . however improvements can be done here . . comment type can be changed similar to the one in vansales widget . here we can override the comment type method to support our own . . too many duplicated code . would appreciate if this could be extracted to a common place within this file . d aae b ea c e f a d acaf d bc aaf e a d e b c d d db f e f f a a f 	refactoring suggestion

submodule id should be derived by the submodule name not through the id . i would suggest the same companyid as well	buggycode suggestion

why is the class util ? shouldn t it be a config class ? please rename here and wherever you think is necessary	spelling suggestion

please add constants here	buggycode suggestion
camelcase	spelling suggestion
camelcase and no setters ?	buggycode suggestion
why is the vendor switch class here ? if it s because of health check it shouldn t be here after it failed . rather you would check the health before sending the mail through ses or smtp go . please remove this here	buggycode suggestion
please create a factory class instead of ccalling the base class here . you can take reference from sms consumer service .	buggycode suggestion
this is inefficient . for any multiple large attachments you are going to download all of them here and then check the file size . this will slow down your consumer heavily . please refactor . couple of suggestions . use the metadata object to see if we can use the file size for each attachment . . you can use the notification producer to set the vendor based on the filesize . please explore these options and refactor accordingly . 	buggycode suggestion
please clean up the files once you have downloaded . also you are downloading the files twice everytime . please think about the impact .	buggycode suggestion
for which vendor ?	questioning
for multiple recipients how is this handled ?	questioning
we should not be getting the entire notification config object . you should be getting only the smtp go config and it s relevant config here	buggycode suggestion
so the entire message with attachments is sent as a string ? not a multipart form data ?	buggycode suggestion
this piece of code is not switching email vendors it s just sending the mail to the fallback vendor . this code should be handling the health check and maybe the attachment size and then decide which vendor it should forward appropriately .	buggycode suggestion
if you are using this then i want the corresponding test cases .	completeness suggestion
i want test cases for smtp go vendor calls	completeness suggestion
should fail here	buggycode suggestion
please rename to non util . also see if you have the time to refactor the remaining pieces of config class	spelling suggestion

 abb bdc c bd a fff a what is the usecase of updating inactive outlets data is there any usecase ? when outlet is inactive we cant do any transaction to that outlet right	questioning
 b dfc e b aaff the reason is that when a new customer comes in and loads all outlets in bizom and when few outlets are inactive and when he tries to put in the old sales of other software to bizom through mdm for historical and report purposes this condition will not allow him to add the sale .	logical suggestion

can we add transactiontype as well ?	code suggestion
 af b a b c data inline card data inline card please look into this post i feel adding both will be helpful .	logical suggestion
if we saving outlet id then its outlet . if its warehouse then use warehouse id in orgid .	logical suggestion
if the fromorgtype is warehouse why are we using fromoutletid instead of warehouse id ?	buggycode suggestion
it will give multiple entries for single user	buggycode suggestion

handle it for skucode and batch erpid	code suggestion
can we use a foreach loop to fetch the batches and skunits data in one shot so that we can validate them in one go ? because there is a separate query for batches and a separate query for salemansalereturns batches joins .	buggycode suggestion

make here also with warehouse id group for all its skunit ids . then or conditions .	code suggestion
remove invalid space	refactoring suggestion
remove active column from here .	code suggestion
can we use !empty here before doing the set combine ?	code suggestion
 f da c d b eb data for warehouse id only will be given and skunit it s here you might get rows instead of rows . also note skugrpcond is doing a search on parent skunit id and child skunit id only no condition of warehouse is handled here .	logical suggestion
can we fix the indentation here if this line is actually required ?	refactoring suggestion
can we move this code below the if empty orderdata just to avoid errors if order id is not present ?	code suggestion
please get setting in model only use function getsettingfromname .	code suggestion
do we need set combine twice here ?	code suggestion
why checking string here . as in function is expecting skunitids as array then there is not requirement to check whether skunitids are string . 	buggycode suggestion
will warehouseids contain single or multiple values ? if multiple then will need to fetch the setting for each warehouse .	logical suggestion
please use trim	code suggestion
please use trim and handle for case sensitive	code suggestion
it has to be array skunitmapping trim skudata skunit skucode 	buggycode suggestion
will it be possible to use a foreach instead of set extract here ? now there are set extract used on the same dataset for outletids fromoutletids and warehouseids and this can be done using one loop .	buggycode suggestion
can we also validate for the query parameters outletid warehouseid as it can lead to undefined index error if the parameters are not passed ? just for error handling reasons . 	code suggestion
since the response will always be an array of objects can we make it an empty array if there are not data in pendingbillnumbers ? else the response will always contain one object always inside the array with the keys id and text as empty strings .	logical suggestion
are both id and text necessary ? asking since both will always have the same value of payments .billno .	logical suggestion
please use !empty directly it automatically checks for isset as well .	code suggestion
if any of the warehouse id not sent then it will fetch all data . please check this .	buggycode suggestion
is this code required ?	questioning
there is issue in this query with single quote .	buggycode suggestion
needs to be alter table invoicetemplatemappings add index warehuseidindex warehouse id moduletype using btree 	code suggestion
please swap the logic and use isset here . will make it faster	buggycode suggestion
please make it re runable . 	buggycode suggestion
why this empty php tag ?	questioning
